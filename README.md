The PeriFinance-JS Library, forked from synthetix-js, provides a simple pre-packaged API to communicate with [Peri Finance](https://pynths.com) on ethereum.
This is particularly useful for hackathon teams to quickly `npm install peri-finance-js` and start building in just a few minutes.
Under the hood, PeriFinanceJS uses [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) library.

## Install via npm

`npm install peri-finanace-js`
